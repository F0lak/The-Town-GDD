A big question that I have is whether or not the game should include basic AI for certain jobs.  The advantage of AI taking on specific roles in the game is that it can be fun for low player-count servers to run.  The disadvantage is that this opens up a lot of feature creep and discussion on what exactly the AI would do.
### advantages
- can create more fun
- allows lower-count servers to still have more fun
- allows for single-player gameplay
### disadvantages
- opens the door to a lot of feature creep
## concept
The first question would be what role would the AI fulfill.  There are a lot of ideas that I have here, like plugging into an LLM for engaging roleplay opportunities, but I don't think that would be particularly necessary, but could be fun, especially if the AI had access to enough behaviours.

The AI could be as simple as mobs that wander the map depending on their role and not really doing anything to impact the game world in each round.  This would be pretty dull and boring after awhile.

One interesting thought would be for there to be certain actions (ie: violence) that would trigger the AI to run and alert a guard.  Having AI guards in general would be a fairly straightforward process, but again it opens the door to feature creep.  What would the guards do?  Patrol? guard a certain location?

For now, given the relative complexity of the game itself, I don't know that AI is something that should be on the table at this time, but I'm still completely undecided.
