Movement is done with WASD

	SLEEP ON THIS AND COME BACK TO IT

Q / E are used to "Grab". If a player grabs with one hand then they are "holding on to" what ever they grabbed and will follow it if it moves.  If they grab with both hands then they will restrict movement of whatever they have grabbed.

When a player is grabbed by another player they can mash the "Space bar" to escape the grab.  Likewise, when a player has grabbed another player, they can mash the spacebar to maintain their hold.
It's like a bar that goes back and forth.

CTRL + Q / E is used to drop the item in the left / right hand

LMB / RMB is used to perform an Action with the Left / Right hand

Ctrl + LMB / RMB is used to force a passive interaction with the left / right hand

Actions are dictated by what is held in the hand in question.
	For example, an Action with most things would be an attack (LMB holding a Sword or a Stick in the left hand)
	Every object will have an Action defined that dictates what this action would be.
Passive interactions are things like opening a door, opening a chest, etc.
