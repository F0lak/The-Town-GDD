The Town is populated with several species of animal, inspired by the Fauna of Ireland and Fantasy.
Not all animal types will spawn every round.

Animals can be considered either wild or domestic.  Wild animals can be tamed during gameplay by feeding them and not being aggressive towards them (this will be fun to code)
## Large Animals
### Deer
A big beefy herbivore.  Males have horns and are aggressive towards the townspeople.
### Bear
Grumpy and Scratchy.  Bears are wildly aggressive and wander the forest.
### Cattle
Found only on the ranch.  Cattle are big beefy beefs.
### Boar
Extremely aggressive and violent.  A wild boar will chase down anything it deems to be a threat.
### Wolves
Bark Bark Growl!
They move around in packs and may come into the town looking for food

## Small Animals
### Sheep
Little sheepy bois.  They are completely passive and weak.
### Hare
Little hoppy bois.  Completely passive, but very skiddish and very fast.  They live in burrows
### Dogs
Puppers that wander the Town.  Pet Dogs can be purchased as one of the [[Unlocks]] in the game.
