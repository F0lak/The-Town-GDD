As players play the game and complete rounds and objectives they gain in-game currency which can be used to purchase several things such as:
- New [[Jobs]]
- New [[Decks]]
- Vanity Items
- Appearance Customizations / Skins
- OOC Chat Flourish

Unlocks will be persistent across servers.
Unlocks might maybe be purchasable using real-world currency as a means to monetize the game.

Vanity items should never factor in to game mechanics.

They can be appearance related, or different types of clothing or ooc chat flourish.
