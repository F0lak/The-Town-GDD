The game takes place over the course of a round.
At the beginning of the round, players select their name, bid on jobs and select their appearance and starting kit.

Rounds all have a [[Round Prompt]] which serves as a starting setup for the round.

Round all last for 1 hour, unless otherwise specified.  10 minutes before the end of a round, players are given the option to vote on extending the round by an additional 20 minutes.  This process repeats until the number of votes to extend the round is less than 50% of the players online and not in the lobby.

Players can also trigger a vote to end the round early, but this can only be triggered every 10 minutes.

At the beginning of every round, players are dealt 3 cards from their available decks
Cards represent objectives that the players must complete during the round.
The reward from completing objectives is in-game currency that can be used to unlock new decks and [[Unlocks]]

At the end of every round, players are allowed to nominate one other player for their performance during the round.  [[Nominations]] earn players extra currency and can be tallied for awards and achievements.
